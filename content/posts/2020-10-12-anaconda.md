### What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### What is it used for?

Anaconda comes with Python and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies and most common data science packages in Python. So in short, if you are looking to get started in Data Science, Anaconda might be your quick start application containing following tools:

## How to install it?

#### Windows

- Download and run the [Graphical Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with `.exe` extension for Windows.

- You will then have option to add Anaconda to Path environment variable (recommended). Choose your desired options, and installation will then begin.
- Finally, you will have option to run Ananconda.

#### Linux

- Download the [Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) file with `.sh` extension for Linux.
- Open terminal in the directory containing downloaded file, and run:
  ```console
  bash ~/path-to-directory/anaconda-file-for-linux.sh
  ```
- Choose `yes` (recommended) for all the options prompted.
- Run the following command to activate environment:
  ```console
  conda activate
  ```
- Finally, run the command to open navigator:
  ```console
  anacona-navigator
  ```
- You will be presented with Anaconda Navigator.

#### Mac OS

- Download and run the [Graphical Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with `.pkg` extension for Mac OS.
- Select `Move to Bin` when you are prompted after the installation finishes.
- Launch `Anaconda Navigator` from the Launch pad of your PC.
  Congratulations, you have Anaconda set up successfully.

### Where do I start?

This could be the first question you ask yourself after you have Anaconda ready. The short answer is, it depends. There are many platforms online like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) which provide integrated tools to run some basic Data Science codes online.

However, if you wanna have the freedom and flexibility to modify your own code and experiment with it, you can do so with `Jupyter Notebook`. We are going to see how to get that set up.

#### Windows

3 ways to open a Jupyter notebook:

- **Windows Start Menu** -

  1. Open the Windows start menu and select `Anaconda3 (64 bit) --> Jupyter Notebook`.
  2. In the upper right select `New --> Python 3`.
  3. A new notebook will open as a new tab in your web browser:

- **Anaconda Prompt** -

  1. Go to the Windows start menu and select `Anaconda Prompt` under `Anaconda3`.
  2. At the Anaconda Prompt type:
     ```console
     > jupyter notebook
     ```
  3. A web browser should open, and you should be able to see the `Jupyter file browser`. If a web browser doesn't open automatically, you can copy the web address from the `Anaconda Prompt` and paste it into a web browser's address bar.

- **Anaconda Navigator** -

  1. Open Anaconda Navigator using the Windows start menu and select `Anaconda3 (64-bit) --> Anaconda Navigator`.
  2. In the middle of the page, in the Jupyter notebook tile, click `Launch`.
  3. A `Jupyter file browser` will open in a web browser tab.
  4. In the upper right select `New --> Python 3`.
  5. A new notebook will open as a new tab in your web browser.

### Linux and Mac OS

The method is quite similar to Windows. Probably you should try it yourself? :wink:
