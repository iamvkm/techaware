              The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment &ndash; including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications &ndash; directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.
Installing WSL Before we get started, update your machine. You need to be running on Windows 10 version 1903 build 18362 or higher.

              This is a pathway I took to learn to make attractive websites (like one you are on now) from scratch. All the resources listed here will be available for free on Internet &amp; you need not pay a buck for anything.
Note: This is not a site builder guide. We will be talking about coding!
You cannot write the content on a website without the knowledge of HTML. It tells you how to place simple texts and images on screen.

              Introduction It&rsquo;s said that in the hacking world that if you cannot find a free way of getting a paid thing on the Internet, you are not looking enough.
Below is a list of some apps &amp; websites that may help you to so. They are absolutely free of price. However, you may have to click a couple of more buttons (and probably wait for couple of seconds) to get the product.
